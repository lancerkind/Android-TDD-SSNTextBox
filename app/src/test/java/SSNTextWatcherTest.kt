/**
 * What we learned:
 * - Look carefully for the K symbol on the class you create.
 * - turn on the phone in the simulator
 * - Kotlin has single inheritance.
 * - Refactoring - if you feel like you did too much manual in your refactoring, and
 * you don't fast micro tests to confirm correctness, then backup and start again.
 * - Undo affects multiple files.
 *
 * Strong Style Pairing -> next week?
 *
 * Example local unit test, which will execute on the development machine (host).
 *
 * See [testing documentation](http://d.android.com/tools/testing).
